# Translations

Help translate Netdex into your language.

## Getting Started

First of all, do not consider translating into any language you do not speak fluently/natively.

Note that english is the source language, but you may look at any file for reference.

Now for transating you will need to keep the [two-letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language in mind.

If you do not spot a txt with your language code as name, [open an issue](https://github.com/netdexco/Translations/issues/new) and wait for a reply.

Otherwise, you can just [fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and make changes to your language file and finally create a pull request.

## Why Translate?

For the people that just don't understand english properly it is nice to have human-generated translations.

...and if you do decide to translate 30+ strings, we will mention you in [the credits](https://netdex.co/credits) and verify you on Netdex (yes, something for your ego!), which will of course require you to specify your Netdex username in the pull request.
