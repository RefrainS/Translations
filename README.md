#Translations
Help translate Netdex into your language.

## Getting Started
Before translating, make sure that you are a native and/or fluid speaker of the language to avoid mistakes.

If you we do not have a file with your two-letter [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) please [open an issue](https://github.com/netdexco/Translations/issues/new).

However, If we do already have a file with your language code you can just [fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and create a pull request once you're done.

## Why Translate?

Translations, in general, are good for everyone, that doesn't speak english as well as you.
And if you do decide to translate Netdex in a bigger manner (30+ strings), we will mention you in [the credits](https://netdex.co/credits) and verify you on Netdex (you'll have to provide us with your Netdex name in your pull request).
