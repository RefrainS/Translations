# Translations

Help translate Netdex into your language.

## Getting Started

First of all, do not consider translating into any language you do not speak fluently/natively.

Note: English is the source language, but you may look at any file for reference.

Now, for transating you will need to keep the [two-letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language in mind.

If you do not spot a `.txt` with your language code as name, [open an issue](https://github.com/netdexco/Translations/issues/new) and wait for a reply.

Otherwise, you can just [fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), make changes to your language file and finally create a pull request.

## Why Translate?

For the people that just don't understand english as good as you, it is nice to have human-generated translations and if you do decide to translate a good amount of strings, we will mention you in [the credits](https://netdex.co/credits) and verify you on Netdex (yes, something for your ego!), which will, of course, require you to specify your Netdex username in the pull request.
